## <span style="color:purple"> About Me </span>



I am an assistant professor in the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation ([IHPME](https://ihpme.utoronto.ca/)) at the University of Toronto. I completed my PhD in Biostatistics under Professor and Senior Scientist, [Dr. Eleanor Pullenayegum](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/pullenayegum/) in the Department of Child Health Evaluative Sciences at the Hospital for Sick Children and the Division of Biostatistics at Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto.

Broadly speaking, my research interests centre on the application of statistical methods to clinical and public health evidence-based research and the development of novel Bayesian estimation methods for handling statistical inference, in particular causal inference, with complex longitudinal data.

Besides academic work and creating fun data visualizations in R, I love watercolour painting, taking contemporary dance classes in Toronto, and playing piano as an adult beginner.
